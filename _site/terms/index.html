  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
        The following are the Terms and Conditions (Terms) of Bombay Studio BV (Bombay) with referred offices at Provenierstersstraat 13 9000 Gent Belgium with business registration number BEXXXXXX. The Terms apply on all the quotations, offers and agreements that Bombay sends out. When working together with Bombay there will be a statement of work and the conditions stated in the statement of work may also apply to the offers made by Bombay.
        Bombay Studio BV<br>
        Provenierstersstraat 13<br>
        9000 Gent<br>
        Belgium<br>
        VAT number: XXXX<br>

  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Applicability</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
      Bombay is in business to provide top notch services to clients. The services are based on quotations and statements of work. A quotation is never binding until it has been signed by both client and Bombay. VAT should still be added to the total price shown on the document only if stated otherwise on the document. The top notch services that we want to provide are under reasonable expectations. We’ll do everything we can to deliver everything in a professional manner and in accordance to the standards in the industry. It speaks for itself that we can only deliver the services we promised to deliver if we have all the information, all the documents and other requirements that are necessary to fulfil the job that Bombay  agreed on doing. Bombay may work with subcontractors for part of the service or the complete service that the client requested Bombay to do for them.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Termination</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
        When the statement of work has been signed there is no way to cancel or terminate the agreement anymore. Next to the initial work we do for a client there is also always a recurring service that has a duration of 12 months that is included in the statement of work (unless stated otherwise) that cannot be cancelled. Changes to the statement of work after it has been signed is possible only when Bombay agrees on the changes after they have been submitted in writing by the client. Termination of the agreements made between Bombay and the client can only be done by a registered letter in the event of a bankruptcy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Intellectual property</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
      During the process and creation/ design of everything related to the brand/site (this includes but is not limited to: copy, photography, video, logo’s, sentence that defines the brand, colour schemes, icons, etc) everything is completely owned by Bombay except when it is concretely stated in the statement of work or agreement. All of the intellectual property described above is only transferred after payment of invoices that encompass all the work done to create the intellectual property. A transfer of the intellectual property does not mean that the client can sublicence the intellectual property to a third party.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Force majeur</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
        In case of force majeure, we are not obliged to fulfil our obligations. In that case, we may either suspend our obligations for the duration of the state of force majeure or definitely repudiate the agreement. Events of force majeure are all circumstances external to our will and control that render the respect of our obligations completely or partly impossible. Such events include amongst others strikes, fire, disruption of energy supplies or telecommunication networks or communication systems and/or the temporary down-time of the webshop, late delivery or absence of delivery by suppliers or other third parties,…
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Confidentiality</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
        During the collaboration between the client and Bombay confidential information may be shared from Bombay to the client or from the client to Bombay. Both parties are not entitled to disclose any of the confidential information on the other party without very clear written consent that certain info can be shared. These rules also apply to contractors and third parties that might also be working on the project directly or indirectly.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Personal data</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
      If Bombay has access to personal data Bombay is viewed as a data controller, not as a data processor only if stated otherwise in the statement of work or requested specifically by the client in writing.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Hand over phase</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
      If a website/platform/shop or something similar (product) has been created for a client there is a period in which the client can bring up problems that were not seen by Bombay during testing. Of course this is only on features that were explicitly stated in the statement of work, not on undiscussed features of the product. The period in which the client can bring up issues is 10 weeks after the official delivery of the product.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Use of external services</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
      If Bombay uses external services to fulfil the work agreed in the statement of work, Bombay will be in no way liable for things that are going wrong with these external services. It can help the client solve the issues that are caused by a third party but this will be under a new quotation and statement of work. Furthermore Bombay will never be responsible for loss in revenue, loss in customers, increase in cost structure, loss in documents or other digital files or anything similar to these mentioned increased strains to the client in any way. This means that everything that  impacts the business of the client that has been done by Bombay is solely the responsibility of the client and never of Bombay.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Use of product</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
      When Bombay has made a product for its client, the client is completely responsible for how it uses the product Bombay has made. There is no responsibility whatsoever that Bombay can take if the client doesn’t use the product according to applicable rules and regulations. If Bombay hears, sees or can prove that a client uses the work that Bombay did in any way it thinks is illegal Bombay can unilaterally withdraw itself from any future agreement with a written notice where it explains why it thinks certain rules and regulations have been violated.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Invoicing and payment</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
      Prices that are shown on the statement of work do not always include travel costs. If it were necessary an employee or contractor of Bombay to travel these costs should be paid by the client. Invoices can be sent every two weeks if not stated otherwise in the statement of work even if the work in the statement of work has not been completely finished. Money that needs to be spent in the name of the client such as adwords marketing spent will be paid in advance and Bombay will not put the relevant campaigns live before the payment has been received. Invoices need to be paid within 30 days after receiving the invoice. Latency fees apply from the moment the invoice has not been paid within 30 days upon receiving. Latency fees include but are not limited by the following fees: € 100 administrational costs, legal fees, 10% on total invoice amount due to latency, amount of hours a contractor or employee has put into chasing the right person to make sure the invoice gets paid at a rate of € 80 per hour. Complaints on invoices should be done within 5 business days of the date on which the invoice has been received by the client and should be done in writing.

      <h2 class="h2 large marg-bottom">Jurisdiction</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="marg-bottom">
